You may go to the next lesson for starting out! \n\n Keep this a secret to everybody! 🤫 \n\n Godot 4.4 is a game engine that allows you to create 2d and 3d games by using a Node system. Godot is friendly to both programming newbies and expert code hermits, so you can use it to create your own game without having to learn a lot of new stuff.\n However, if you have a programming background, your gamedev journey will go swimmingly, as Godot lets you use GDScript, C#, or even VisualScript to create your game. We'll be focusing on GDScript, since it's the most supported and easiest to configure with Godot's systems.",

        "description": "The Godot development cycle is a process that involves creating, testing, and iterating on your game. You can create scenes, add nodes, and write scripts to define the behavior of your game. The cycle typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Create a new scene or open an existing one.\n2. Add nodes to the scene to define the structure of your game.\n3. Write scripts to define the behavior of the nodes.\n4. Test your game by running it in the editor.\n5. Iterate on your design by making changes and testing again. \n\n Since all elements in Godot usually involve the creation of nodes separately, you'll find that the best way to compound scenes together is to create a main root node, which you will add your created scenes to as nodes. Nodes inside the main node that you are working in are accessible by using functions such as get_node(\"NodeName\") or get_children(). \n\n Since game architectures are an important part of game development, you may find that implementing structures such as Entity-Component-System (ECS) or Model-View-Controller (MVC) are useful for your game, and are easily implemented in Godot due to its node structure.",

There are two ways to connect signals: \n\n1. Connect a signal to a function in the same or another script using the connect() method. \n2. Connect via the inspector, which allows you to connect signals to functions in the editor. \n\n Use cases for signals include: \n\n- Responding to user input (e.g., button clicks)\n- Triggering events in other nodes (e.g., animations, sounds)\n- Communicating between different parts of your game (e.g., game state changes)",

We also preload a texture and assign it to the sprite's texture property. \n\n You can use different node types to create different types of objects in your game.

        "description": "In Godot, you can create animations using the AnimationPlayer node. The AnimationPlayer node allows you to create and play animations for any property of any node in your scene. You can create animations for position, rotation, scale, color, and more.\n\n In this example, we create an AnimationPlayer node and play an animation called my_animation. You can create animations using the Animation panel in the editor. \n\n You can use animations to create:\n\n- Character animations (e.g., walking, jumping)\n- UI animations (e.g., button hover effects)\n- Environmental animations (e.g., moving platforms, doors) \n\n The general best practice for use of animations from the AnimationPlayer of a specific node is to name specific animations based on their context use. This is because there may be cases where external sibling or parent nodes may need to access the AnimationPlayer of a specific node. In this case, depending on the reaction of the animated node, you may need to trigger an animation based on the context of the node that is triggering it. \n\n For example, say an enemy node hits a player node. You would expect the player to play a corresponding hit animation. If you attach a corresponding signal or behavior, your animation player will be able to respond correctly by executing the correct animation through the use of the play function and the name of the specified animation. \n\n ## Complex Cases \n\n That said, the behavior of a complex game will probably require you to create a custom animation system that allows you to trigger animations based on the context, reaction and other factors. In this case, you may prefer to use AnimationTree, which allows you to create complex animation systems using a node-based interface. \n\n You can also use AnimationTree to create blend trees, which allow you to blend between different animations based on parameters. This is useful for creating smooth transitions between animations, such as blending between walking and running animations. \n\n This is particularly useful in the case that you are managing your game with a state machine. In this case, you can use AnimationTree to create a state machine that allows you to switch between different animations based on the current state of your game. \n\n You can also use AnimationTree to create animation layers, which allow you to play multiple animations at the same time. This is useful for creating complex animations that involve multiple parts of a character or object.",

        "description": "In game development, a state machine is a design pattern that allows you to manage the different states of your game. In Godot, you can create a state machine using an enum and a variable to track the current state. \n\n In this example, we create a simple state machine with three states: IDLE, WALKING, and JUMPING. We use the set_state() function to change the current state and print the corresponding message. \n\n State machines are useful for managing complex game logic, such as character animations, AI behavior, and game flow. You can use state machines to create:\n\n- Character states (e.g., idle, walking, jumping)\n- AI states (e.g., patrol, chase, attack)\n- Game flow states (e.g., menu, playing, paused) \n\n State machines are a powerful tool for managing complex game logic. You can use them to create more organized and maintainable code. \n\n ## Node State Machine \n\n Enum state machines are not the only way to create state machines. By taking advantage of the node inheritance system, you can create a state machine that is composed of nodes. For example, imagine an enemy that has a set amount of animations and behaviors: if it is idle, it plays the idle animation and moves around. If it spots the player, it engages in chase and plays a running animation. If it loses sight of the player, it goes back to its origin point, and then goes back to its idle state. \n\n All of this can be achieved by attaching these behaviours to a state machine that manages all of the mentioned behaviors as nodes. Since all of these nodes would have a corresponding script attached to them, which would execute the said logic once the node is active, you would have a state machine composed entirely of node behavior. This is a way to extend the state machine pattern beyond the enum state machine, and allows you to create more complex state machines that are easier to manage and allow for scalability and complexity. \n\n ## Animation State Machine \n\n You can also use AnimationTree to create a state machine that allows you to switch between different animations based on the current state of your game. This is useful for creating complex animations that involve multiple parts of a character or object. In comparison to a node state machine, the animation state machine is bound to the use of animations as flags for the state machine. This means that you can use the animation state machine to create a state machine that is based on the current animation of the character or object. This ties the current animation to action, effectively creating a state machine that is based on the current animation of the character or object. \n\n This approach is generally preferred in cases where you need certain animations to influence action, such as in 3D physics games where models, collisions and other factors are paramount as important as other script behavior. For example, imagine a game that implements a parry/ripose mechanic. In this case, you would need to create a state machine that is able to evaluate the current animation frames and correctly assert which action occurs based on the elapsed time or behavior of the playing animation. \n\n Animation State Machines can also be achieved in 2D games, but because the general nature of 2D games does not lend itself to always exhibiting cases where complex animations must influence action, it is not necessarily one of the best approaches to take head first due to its complexity, as you are probably able to create simpler state machines.",
