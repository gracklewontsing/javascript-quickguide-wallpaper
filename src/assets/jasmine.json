      "description":"Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It provides a clean syntax for writing tests and supports spies, mocks, and assertions. Jasmine is often paired with Karma for running tests in various browsers. In order to use Jasmine, you need to include the Jasmine library in your project. This can be achieved by either downloading the library files or using a package manager like npm. Once you have the library set up, you can start writing your tests using the describe and it functions. \n\n The describe function is used to group related tests, while the it function defines an individual test case. Inside the it function, you can use various matchers provided by Jasmine to make assertions about your code's behavior.",

      "description":"In Jasmine, you can create nested suites using the describe function. This allows you to organize your tests hierarchically. In this example, we have a suite for Math operations and a nested suite for Addition. Each suite can contain multiple specs (test cases). \n\n ## Specs \n\n Specs are individual test cases defined using the `it` function. Each spec should contain a single assertion that checks a specific behavior of your code. In this example, we have a spec that checks if adding two numbers produces the expected result.",

      "description":"Expectations are the core of Jasmine's testing framework. They are used to assert that a certain condition is true.

      "description":"Jasmine provides a variety of matchers to make assertions about your code's behavior. Matchers are functions that check if a value meets certain conditions. In this example, we use the toEqual matcher to check if two strings are equal. \n\n ## Common Matchers \n\n - `toBe(value)`: Checks if the actual value is the same as the expected value. \n - `toEqual(value)`: Checks if the actual value is equal to the expected value. \n - `toContain(value)`: Checks if an array or string contains a specific value. \n - `toBeTruthy()`: Checks if a value is truthy. \n - `toBeFalsy()`: Checks if a value is falsy. \n\n ## Custom Matchers \n\n You can also create custom matchers to extend Jasmine's functionality. Custom matchers allow you to define your own assertions based on your specific needs. This can be useful for creating more readable and expressive tests. For example, you can create a custom matcher to check if an object has a specific property or if a string matches a certain pattern. Custom matchers can be defined using the `jasmine.addMatchers` function, which allows you to specify the behavior of your custom matcher and how it should be reported in test results. Your custom matcher would look like this:\n\n ```javascript\n jasmine.addMatchers({\n   toBeEven: function() {\n     return {\n       compare: function(actual) {\n         return {\n           pass: actual % 2 === 0,\n           message: actual + ' is not even'\n         };\n       }\n     };\n   }\n });\n ```\n\n You can then use your custom matcher in your tests like this:\n\n ```javascript\n expect(4).toBeEven();\n ```",

      "description":"Spies are a powerful feature of Jasmine that allow you to track function calls and their arguments. You can create spies on existing functions or create new spy functions. In this example, we create a spy on the myMethod function of an object and check if it was called. \n\n ## Spying on Functions \n\n You can use the `spyOn` function to create a spy on an existing function. This allows you to track how many times the function was called, what arguments were passed, and whether it was called with specific arguments. In this example, we create a spy on the myMethod function and check if it was called using the `toHaveBeenCalled` matcher. \n\n ## Stubbing Functions \n\n You can also use spies to stub functions, which means replacing the original implementation with a custom implementation. This is useful for testing how your code interacts with external dependencies without actually calling them. You can use the `and.callFake` method to provide a custom implementation for the spy. For example:\n\n ```javascript\n spyOn(myObj, 'myMethod').and.callFake(function() {\n   return 'Stubbed value';\n });\n ```\n\n This allows you to control the behavior of the function during testing.",

      "description":"Jasmine supports asynchronous testing using the done callback. This allows you to test code that involves asynchronous operations, such as AJAX requests or timers. In this example, we use setTimeout to simulate an asynchronous operation and call the done function when the test is complete. \n\n ## Asynchronous Code \n\n When testing asynchronous code, you need to ensure that Jasmine waits for the asynchronous operation to complete before checking the expectations. You can do this by passing a done callback to the it function. When the asynchronous operation is complete, you call the done function to signal that the test is finished. This prevents Jasmine from prematurely reporting the test as complete.",

      "description":"Jasmine provides setup and teardown functions that allow you to run code before and after each test. This is useful for initializing test data or cleaning up after tests. In this example, we use beforeEach and afterEach to define setup and teardown code. \n\n ## Setup Code \n\n The `beforeEach` function is called before each spec in the suite. You can use it to set up any necessary state or data for your tests. For example, you might want to create a new instance of an object or reset some variables before each test. \n\n ## Teardown Code \n\n The `afterEach` function is called after each spec in the suite. You can use it to clean up any resources or state that were created during the test. This ensures that each test runs in isolation and does not affect other tests. \n\n ## Other Setup/Teardown Functions \n\n In addition to `beforeEach` and `afterEach`, Jasmine also provides `beforeAll` and `afterAll` functions that run once before or after all tests in a suite. These can be useful for setting up global state or resources that are shared across multiple tests. For example, you might want to establish a database connection before running all tests and close it afterward.",

      "description": "In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the current context in which a function is executed. In the context of a method, `this` refers to the object that the method is called on. In this example, we define an object with a method that returns its value using this. \n\n This is particularly important in Jasmine tests, as the context of `this` can change depending on how the test is defined. In Jasmine, `this` inside a spec refers to the current spec context, which allows you to access properties and methods defined in the suite. \n\n ## Arrow Functions \n\n Note that arrow functions do not have their own `this` context. If you use an arrow function as a method, `this` will refer to the surrounding context, not the object itself. To ensure that `this` refers to the object, use regular function syntax. For example:\n\n ```javascript\n var obj = {\n   value: 42,\n   getValue: () => {\n     return this.value;\n   }\n }; \n ```\n\n In this case, `this.value` will not refer to the object's value, but rather to the surrounding context's value. This is a common pitfall when using arrow functions in JavaScript, so be cautious when using them in methods.",

The constructor takes a function with two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`. You call `resolve` when the asynchronous operation is successful and `reject` when it fails. \n\n ## Handling Promises \n\n You can handle the result of a promise using the `then` method.

In BDD, you write tests in a way that describes the expected behavior of the system in natural language. This helps improve communication between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders. \n\n In comparison to TDD, BDD emphasizes collaboration and understanding of the requirements. It encourages you to write tests that describe how the system should behave in different scenarios. This can lead to better test coverage and more meaningful tests that reflect the user's needs. \n\n BDD tests are often written in a Given-When-Then format, where you describe the initial state (Given), the action taken (When), and the expected outcome (Then). This format makes it easier to understand the purpose of the test and its relation to user stories or requirements. For example, instead of writing a test that checks if a function returns the correct value, you would write a test that describes the behavior of the system in a specific scenario. This helps ensure that the tests are aligned with the user's expectations and requirements.

This helps ensure that your application behaves correctly in a production-like environment. \n\n End-to-end tests are typically more complex and time-consuming than unit or integration tests, as they involve multiple components and their interactions. They can help identify issues that may not be apparent when testing individual components in isolation. End-to-end tests can also help ensure that changes to one component do not break the functionality of other components. \n\n In Jasmine, you can write end-to-end tests using the same syntax as unit tests. You can create a suite of tests that cover different scenarios and interactions between components. This helps ensure that your code is robust and works correctly in a real-world environment.",
